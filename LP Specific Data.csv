The public pension scheme’s Asia Private Equity Investment Team will invest
KRW 1.2 trillion across four domestic private equity funds and four domestic venture capital funds. It will select private equity
managers in July 2024 and venture capital managers in November 2024. For private equity, the institution is open to both primary
and secondary strategies, as well as co-investments if the requested commitment amount is above KRW 200 billion with no fee and
no carry condition. Within venture capital, it is open to all venture stages. The South Korea-based investor will select its domestic
fund managers via RFP.
Regarding overseas investments, NPS will continue to invest with a global outlook and a wide range of strategies across diverse
industries. The institution will focus on value-adding investments, secondaries, and search for private equity managers specialized in
middle-market deals. The pension fund is open to investing with both new and existing managers.","National Pension Service (NPS) holds a preference for buyout, growth, secondary, venture capital, co-investment strategies.
Geographically, the public pension fund's private equity portfolio is split 20.2% to domestic investments and 79.8% to overseas,
including North America (24%), Europe (14.8%), Asia and emerging countries in South America (5.05%), and global (35.9%). It has
partnerships with more than 100 private equity firms globally. It targets a wide range of industries, including business services,
financial services, energy, consumer services, healthcare, and technology sectors.
NPS gains exposure to the asset management company’s equity through its investments in commingled funds targeting the fund
management companies. The institution invests in fund managers to strengthen its partnership with GPs and negotiating power in
terms of management fees and investment opportunities.
NPS deploys between KRW 30 billion and KRW 60 billion per domestic venture capital fund. For private equity funds, it typically
allocates between KRW 100 billion and KRW 350 billion per onshore fund and between USD 100 million and USD 200 million per
offshore fund. It may stretch its ticket size on a case-by-case basis. The institution is open to investing through separate accounts
and expects the use of such investments to increase in the longer term. The public pension scheme acts as a first-close investor but
will not invest with first-time managers. It prefers GPs who have a demonstrable record of providing investment returns above the
second quartile. The company also prefers managers who maintain price discipline. When deciding on investments, NPS takes
environmental and social factors into consideration.
NPS is also a direct investor in the asset class. The institution deems its private equity direct investment activities to increase going
forward. It also gains access to the asset class through Corporate Partnership Funds (COPA Funds) established by NPS and South
Korean conglomerates, such as Samsung, Hyundai Motors, GS, and KT Corporation. COPA Funds support domestic companies

which also includes balanced, direct secondaries, early-stage, fund of funds, venture, growth, and secondaries fund commitments.
Columbia University Endowment also considers investment opportunities on a global scale targeting North America, Europe, and
Asia as well as some exposure to emerging markets in the Middle East, Israel, the Nordic region, and South Asia. It typically commits
between USD 5 million and USD 15 million per fund. The endowment invests in various industries including business, consumer,
financial services, healthcare, life sciences, manufacturing, industrials, media, communications, technology, and telecoms.
The endowment has been investing in the private equity asset class since the early 1990s. Its private equity investments are handled
by the university's wholly-owned subsidiary, Columbia Investment Management Company (IMC). The endowment felt that this has
enabled it to take advantage of different investment styles and vehicles to provide a higher total return over time while maintaining
an acceptable level of risk.",119.0,147558.0,115.0,65087.0,7.0,1231.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,313.0,1.0,120.0,4.0,2475.0,23.0,59439.0,7.0,1559.0,17.0,5119.0,13.0,3297.0,7.0,2380.0,20.0,16404.0,6.0,9485.0,15.0,12481.0,12.0,5640.0,11.0,11723.0,14.0,10611.0,8.0,5680.0,3.0,2045.0,3.0,1355.0,8.0,8451.0,2.0,332.0,9.0,6136.0,3.0,4767.0,3.0,8367.0,7.0,2585.0,5.0,1252.0,1.0,967.0,2.0,120.0,2.0,1893.0,3.0,167.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,1906.0,1.0,53.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1857.0,5.0,4246.0,3.0,5019.0,4.0,7300.0,3.0,1125.0,1.0,86.0,140.0,110505.0,35.0,4345.0,24.0,6582.0,21.0,75794.0,7.0,4594.0,8.0,4036.0,8.0,4524.0,1.0,3930.0,32.0,1632.0,22.0,3758.0,27.0,9272.0,38.0,27846.0,45.0,106401.0,333.0,6378.0,40.0,926.0,9.0,149.0,0.0,0.0,22.0,187.0,0.0,0.0,120.0,1529.0,52.0,1135.0,7.0,278.0,4.0,53.0,5.0,132.0,7.0,97.0,10.0,239.0,49.0,1832.0,24.0,348.0,8.0,80.0,4.0,93.0,0.0,0.0,17.0,130.0,36.0,518.0,9.0,142.0,10.0,250.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,33.0,2.0,30.0,3.0,30.0,5.0,102.0,7.0,92.0,4.0,170.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,85.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,23.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,100.0,1.0,16.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,51.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,51.0,71.0,1313.0,90.0,1474.0,85.0,1874.0,1.0,2.0,72.0,1306.0,51.0,1162.0,19.0,347.0,4.0,78.0,6.0,61.0,1.0,25.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,370.0,6171.0,9.0,1068.0,1.0,402.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,Columbia,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1350.0,1.0,575.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,76.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,598.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,926.0,2.0,3700.0,1.0,340.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,95.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,328.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
